      <h2>University Experience</h2>
      <h3>Final Year Project — Fake News Detection System</h3>
      <p>
        Built a fake news detection system using Python and NLP/ML. Compared Logistic Regression + TF-IDF
        against a BERT-based deep learning model (DistilBERT). Integrated with Flask for deployment. Tools:
        scikit-learn, transformers, nltk, torch, Hugging Face, pandas, Guzzle, VSCode.
      </p>
      <h3>Hackcamp (Year 2 Group Project)</h3>
      <p>
        Student Placement Matching Web App partnered with BCS. Led client communications, built
        responsive placement system using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SFIA v8 skill mapping logic. Managed CV uploads

      </p>
      <h3>Computer Graphics — 3D Traffic Simulation (Year 3)</h3>
      <p>
        Developed an interactive 3D traffic simulation in C++ with OpenSceneGraph. Implemented vehicle pathing,
        collision avoidance, traffic light logic, and real-time physics.
      </p>
      <h3>Client Server Systems — Parcel Buddy (Year 2)</h3>
      <p>
        PHP MVC delivery system. Designed relational databases, PDO-based secure queries, live search, Leaflet.js
